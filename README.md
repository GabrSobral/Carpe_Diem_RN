# CarpeDiem

This is a React Native application, and is being built as my final project of my course.
The CarpeDiem can lsit activities to user, based in his life style, and if he has a crisis, an emergency protocol system will be activated, showing a step by step to calm down, and automatically sending a message to a contact previously registered by the user.

The `CarpeDiem API` can be found <a href="https://github.com/GabrSobral/CarpeDIem-API">here<a>
